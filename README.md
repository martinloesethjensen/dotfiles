# dotfiles

To install homebrew casks and formulae use this command:

```bash 
brew bundle
```

Run this command generate new `Brewfile`:

```bash 
brew bundle dump
```

> If you want to generate a new `Brewfile` with updated casks and formulae, then delete the old `Brewfile` if this already exists.
